## in My Opinion sDAI/cNOTE re-staking
   
 borrow at [92 LTV](https://twitter.com/QuidMint/status/1788043869113708955)...with shorts *and* liquidation protection...

There's `deux` and 2 types of `dues`: synthetic `long` or `short`  
are like *Itchy and Scratchy*...`credit` and `debit` (a la *CatDog*);  

this [transmission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intercarrier_method) is coming to [mix](https://youtu.be/ndQM3kVb06I) under-collat with over-collat  
through the Triforce: ~~hook~~ `wind`, ~~line~~ `carry`, and ~~sinker~~ `work` 
  
`Plunge`s `mint`...`flip`...`vote`...`put`...`owe`...`fold`...`call`   
"lookin' too hot? simmer down, or soon you'll get," `clocked`;  

QuidMint Foundation sees over (not over-sieze) [swappable](https://twitter.com/guil_lambert/status/1772423853316219051) `call`    
in the school of trade-offs, sweat equity,  [compensation](https://www.tabers.com/tabersonline/view/Tabers-Dictionary/730522/all/compensation) escalation,   
"yesterday's price is not today's price," in !MO. 1/3 of TVL pays APR   
out of pocket (adds ETH to `wind.debit`), or
pay with QD gains to  
burn `wind.credit`, the debt created in `mint` which fills `carry`    
 

### De*ferral* reserve (not federal)  

Parable of the Chinese farmer (a la John 13:7)...   
"you never count your money, while you're sittin'  
at the table. There'll be time enough for countin'  

when the dealin' done." We never know if the bad  
debt actually happens...in our best interests...like  
Proverbs 11, when all deeds are weighed together.    

Optimised for gas (due to not compounding P&L   
from `carry` constantly, spending gas instead to  
 keep the voted APR medians always up to date...   


The graceful debt: liqui**dated** as a `winner`...(1 per  
!MO); `johnquid` [liquidation]((https://mirror.xyz/quid.eth/LZ4pS8tVAAkZVSYqJWoihs19cdMhgWESsLr9dIhvL40)) (5/11/22) represented  
by ðŸ‘• is passed back and forth between `winner`s.  

`deux` (2x APR) payment is an extra option to treat  
the `work` as [vice versa](https://www.instagram.com/p/CnPsieFKzRQ/),
or `clutch` as slow option:  
pro-rated price, provided continuous 2x payment...

The yield embedded in discounts for QD is used   
partially for paying APR...while profitable trades  
(`fold` by active management) can capture gains  
away from *j'ai la flemme*  (passively managed QD).  
3 Tibetan humors. `wind` is hielo bile, `carry` is ðŸ©¸
