## in my opinion..!nter*M*ittent *O*ffer: MOüî®Lot.sol 

No secondary token, just one. QD is like a promissory note:  
notes are used for settlement. The promise is that 1 QD will  
be worth $1, so that is how QD is valued internally by QU!D    

There's `deux` and 2 types of `dues`: synthetic `long` and `short`  
are like *Itchy and Scratchy*...`credit` and `debit` are like *CatDog*.  

Those are the "primitives"; the main structural elements are sort   
of like hook, line, and sinker: `wind`, `carry`, `work`, respectively.

So, 3 primitives, 3 elements; glue two three's together into 8:
`mint`...`flip`...`vote`...`put`...`borrow`...`fold`...`call`...  
"lookin' too hot? simmer down, or soon you'll get," `clocked`:  

those are all of the externally callable functions in MO.sol...a.k.a.

this [transmission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intercarrier_method) is coming to [mix](https://youtu.be/ndQM3kVb06I) under-collat with over-collat.  
 The original Phat Farm slogan was, "the new American [Dream](https://www.youtube.com/clip/Ugkx6KgnkNJTp-w6l-UJbXc0ctnAmo8LgdOU)," 

a vector object...like an emotionally charged anchor that keeps...

50% USDC, minted against 
150% over-collat, we  assume 1 sDAI  

= $1 in ETH emulates a principal-protected characteristic of zero  
-coupon bonds, and [swappable](https://twitter.com/guil_lambert/status/1772423853316219051) [puts](https://twitter.com/futurenomics/status/1766173245949014373) for the `call` to offering, or   
r[ICO](https://twitter.com/ceterispar1bus/status/1747212170960466316) (r stands for recurring). QuidMint Foundation sees over (not  
over-sieze) !MO as a project for futures students'...`work` credits   

in the school of trade-offs, sweat equity, escalation (love or rage),  
as  the result of hot `wind` (*hamsin*): long or short sin/debt/gilt (one  
word in Sanskrit)...no [*cdp*](https://twitter.com/zellic_io/status/1688666477552193536), only way: `Plunge` into `work` or by !MO  
`mint`...good QD knows when to `fold`...or gets `clocked`: "yester-  

day's price is not today's price," alright? All rise,  
special-purpose depository `_balances` allow  
taking an insured ETH deposit that already has  

volatility protection from MakerDAO, increasing  
its capital efficiency (a.k.a. [capital deepening](https://www.wallstreetmojo.com/capital-deepening/))...  
doing what cultured meat did (but for stake ETH). 

It's not good debt versus bad debt [compensation](https://www.tabers.com/tabersonline/view/Tabers-Dictionary/730522/all/compensation),  
only what we delight in, and how to obtain *Oneg*:  
"no oxygen, can barely `wind` my darkest sin; you  

~~raise release~~ *emit...yofee*...and it's all because of,"  
the main assumption for making the protocol work  
is that a majority of the QD will be utilised in `work`  

most of the time, so  requires [customers](https://twitter.com/QuidMint/status/1784201484143358433) with an  
appetite (and also a tolerance) for risk, provided  
as a service that they're continously paying for...  
(with liquidation protection, with `grace` or not).

The yield embedded in discounts for QD solves   
the "cold-start problem" of incentivising a risk  
matching service as such to *Come Together*...   

This yield is used to pay APR...while profitable  
trades (active management) also capture gains  
away from dormant ROI (in !MO participation):  
see `_maturing[owner].credit` in `_call` 

### Through de*ferral* reserve (not federal)

The cost of using fiat...is...having to pay taxes,   
the cost of using Ethereum: having to pay gas.  

When a `Plugne` sells ether to the protocol  
(for APR or CR up-keep)...then this ether is  
deposited (on behalf of QU!D) into mevETH.  

To let liquidated debt (or anything wet) dry  
quickly: spread it thinly over a large area‚Ä¶  

it's useful to consider the other dimension   
of investing (biggest risk source is time)...   

At the 11th hour, with 2 bulls sauntering down  
a hill, only a more relevant version here is the  
parable of the Chinese farmer (a la John 13:7):  

"You never count your money, while you're sittin'  
at the table. There'll be time enough for countin'  

when the dealin' done." We never know if the bad  
debt actually happens...in our best interests...like  
Proverbs 11, when all deeds are weighed together.    

Governance is one of the coolest features in DeFi...  
though we save on gas from not compounding P&L   
from `carry` constantly, we spend a lil gas to keep  

the voted median (for APR) perpetually up to date.   
If borrowers pay 8% APR, they can get liquidated

by the protocol, but in exchange for giving QU!D  
the privilege of liqui**dating** them: may become a 

lotto `winner` (1 per MO) #1 liquidation (5/11/22)      
represented by üëï is passed between contracts 

for new `winner`s. `deux` (2x APR) payment is  
an extra option to treat the `work` as [vice versa](https://www.instagram.com/p/CnPsieFKzRQ/),

or to slowly liquidate the `Plunge` over time (pro  
rated price) provided continuous 2x payment for  

the privilege of retaining the **perfection rights**   
(based on a concept from liens and [mortgages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celebrity_bond)).
