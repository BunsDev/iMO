## !nter*M*ittent *O*ffering (in my opinion)

The cost of using fiat...is having to pay taxes,   
the cost of using Ethereum: having to pay gas;  
subsidising protection bootstraps tokens' value.  

Following this line of circular reasoning, we produce a  
specialised system of rewards/penalties for protected  
crypto volatility leveraging (both long and short ETH).

There are only two files in this repo. MO and Lock.  
When you put the two together, the "R" is silenced.  
It's got nothing to do with Moloch. H. G. Wells came  
up with underground machine operators ([Morlocks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fa-antuoMUg)).

The original Phat Farm slogan was, "the new American Dream."  
DeFi farming tried to deliver...making something from nothing.

Can't really do that (turns out), but you *can* make nothing from  
 something (liquidation),
so when you *truly* have [something](https://www.instagram.com/p/ChkumrXLNIp/), you  
 like Fat Moe's from the classic  *Once Upon a Time in America*...  

Quid Labs is in the *ingeneur* business of researching financial markets' "*quidditas*", and  
constructing (blockchain-based) apparatus necessary for performing  derivative designs.  


!MO uses the word "offering", but it is *not* an [ICO](https://twitter.com/ceterispar1bus/status/1747212170960466316)...where, usually,  
  prices start around 0 and are expected to grow by at least 100%. 


QuidMint Foundation (parent entity of Quid Labs) over-  
sees !MO as an educational project for futures students.  

!MO is inspired by Imogen Heap's legendary collab with  
 Clams ~~Casino~~ AV or AC
oxygen comes in Oneg pairs (O2)  
`wind` credit and `carry` credit; `work` is  the result of heat.  

The word *token* shares a root with the Germanic & Dutch
words for *teach*:  
**sin, debt, and gilt (same word in Sanskrit); see [WhyPaper](http://mirror.xyz/quid.eth) for details.**


The only way to mint more QD is by !MO, or good trading.  
There are three types of QD. Two types are `_balances`:  
matured (redeemable), in the process of `_maturing`, 3rd  
type, finally, is for `carry` costs (transferrable internally)...



It's becoming more common for ETH to be perceived
by DeFi protocols  
 through a proxy layer of staking
"derviatives". Participants `collect`  
 their
P&L in sDAI ('til then it's consignment inventory, 
APR payments   
and liquidated collateral are retained perpetually as 
contrib. to PCV).

The main assumption for making the protocol work  
is that a majority of the QD will be utilised in `work`  
most of the time, so it requires customers with an  
appetite (and also a tolerance) for risk, provided  
as a service which they're continously paying for.  

The yield embedded in discounts for QD solves   
the "cold-start problem" of incentivising a risk  
matching service as such to [*Come Together*]()... 

Since it's about 50% USDC, but minted against 
150% over-collat ETH,   
we can assume that 1 sDAI 
is worth $1 in ETH...gives us a neat way to  
 do SP (**S**ettlement **P**ool) 
principal-protected Cnotes, emulating some  
 characteristics of a zero-coupon bond and a swappable put option...
## 4 key differences

Neither need a secondary token like FEI/LQTY nor   
~~recovery mode~~ an Apple feature, or a synonym
for  
12 Steps (after you step on it enough you just quit). 

QU!D achieves bank run deterrence differently...  
!MO bills minted take a year to mature before...  
they may become redeemable for sDAI...on the  
cusp of a new !MO (depositors are incentivised  
to restake for another year's worth of gains)...  

"threatened by shadows at night," emit yo fee...  
there's a  *simpler way* of absorbing shards from  
churned balance sheets. Due to  lack of algebraic  
pontification, it doesn't merit a LaTeX paper, but  
neither should it lose out in terms of profitability.

Isoquants are lines on a topographic map. Not so  
quant, but constraints defined a feasible region...  
solutions eclipse us often at a corner somewhere.  


### not so [cross-margin](https://github.com/QuidLabs/legacy/blob/master/contracts/vigorlending/src/vigorlending.cpp#L2554), edges on next !MO

Every QD `_balance` is auto-staked (for solvency)...  
however, staked doesn't mean illiquid...QD balances  
may always be `transfer`ed, but there is no way to  
*unstake*. This simply means that...upon redemption  
for 1 sDAI (after a balance has matured) there is the  
possibility of dilution, with respect to `_get_owe`...


To let liquidated debt (or anything wet) dry  
 quickly: spread it thinly over a large areaâ€¦  
 it's useful to consider the other dimension   
of investing (biggest source of risk is time). 

"Top up" events restore a pledge to min CR...  
can be viewed as *petit mort* (partially clipped):  
these events are automatically invoked when  
one wishes to update their pledge (any from).  

The threshold for liquidation is when the value of debt  
is greater than collat. There's no collat surplus (~10%)  
as there would be if they started at collat/debt of 1.1.

### NFT

If borrowers pay 8% APR, they can get liquidated  
by the protocol, but in exchange for giving QU!D  
the privilege of liquidating them, our associated   

label aggregator creates exclusive, tailor-made  
merch items incorporating borrower personality   
The merch tag has a QR code: links to a YT clip.

The inaugural liquidation (5/11/22 ðŸ‘•) is shared...   
back and forth as a special-purpose instrument:  
pays artists for creating the next `winner` artifact 

If borrowers pay double APR, this allows them to  
exercise an option (the protocol would exercise it   
instead of them if only 1x rate was paid) to treat  

their `work` as vice versa (swapping directions),  
or to slowly liquidate the position over time (pro  
rated price) provided they continue paying 2x for  

the privilege of retaining their **perfection rights**   
(originally a concept from liens and mortgages).  
These perfection rights may be sold on ZigZag.  

### it's the def...erral reserve not...federal

Deferral reserve is probably the favorite feature,  
like that well-known parable about the 11th hour  
featuring two bulls sauntering down a hill, but  
the most relevant version here is the parable of  
the Chinese farmer (also reflected by John 13:7).

We never know if the bad things actually happen...  
in our best interests. As such, there's no concept  
of bad debt until the end like Proverbs 11, when all   
our deeds are weighed in aggregate. To reflect this,  
crystallisation is saved 'til `collect` (at the end).


### Minimum Viable Governance

Governance is one of the coolest features in DeFi.  
It's easy to get it wrong, but that doesn't mean it  
should be included. Theatre's a feature, not a bug.  

Though we save on gas from not having to compound...   
depositors constantly, we spend a bit of gas keeping  
the voted median (for APR) perpetually up to date...
