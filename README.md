## !nter*M*ittent...*O*ffering (in...my...opinion)...

You have to use üóù to `wind` üï∞ right to left ([click](https://mirror.xyz/quid.eth/LZ4pS8tVAAkZVSYqJWoihs19cdMhgWESsLr9dIhvL40) cup and time)  
turning `cat`s into `dog`s by `work` borrowing 1:1 from `carry`;  


**Diet Colla**~~boration~~ with [Clams](https://twitter.com/clammyclams/status/1781831323356733946) ~~Casino~~ AV and i`MOGen`  (heaps).  
this [transmission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intercarrier_method) is coming to mix under-collat with over-collat.  
 The original Phat Farm slogan was, "the new American Dream,"  
DeFi farming tried to deliver...making something from nothing.  

Can't really mog that (turns out), but you *can* make nothin' from  
somethin' (liquidation):
so when you Pusha T-bill or [nothin'](https://www.instagram.com/p/ChkumrXLNIp/), then    
since it's about 50% USDC, minted against 
150% over-collat,   
we  assume 1 sDAI 
= $1 in ETH emulates a principal-protected  

characteristic of zero-coupon bonds and [swappable](https://twitter.com/guil_lambert/status/1772423853316219051) [puts](https://twitter.com/futurenomics/status/1766173245949014373) for  
the `call` to offering, **not** an [ICO](https://twitter.com/ceterispar1bus/status/1747212170960466316) where price action starts at  
0 and expected to grow by 100%. QuidMint Foundation 
sees  
over (not over-sieze) !MO as a project for futures [students](https://www.university.com/)...

`dog` at
`work` is  the result of hot `wind` (*hamsin*): long or short  
sin/debt/gilt (one word in Sanskrit)...no [*cdp*](https://twitter.com/zellic_io/status/1688666477552193536), only way: `Plunge`  
into `Pool` or by !MO `mint`. Good ones know when to`fold`...  
involuntarily, `_yoga`
is handled by `clocked`...3 types of QD...   
`_balances` (redeemable), `_maturing`, and `Plunge`.`carry`
  
Special-purpose depository instritutions allow  
taking an insured ETH deposit that already has  
volatility propection from MakerDAO, increasing  
its capital efficiency (a.k.a. [capital deepening](https://www.wallstreetmojo.com/capital-deepening/))...  

It's not good debt versus bad debt [compensation](https://www.tabers.com/tabersonline/view/Tabers-Dictionary/730522/all/compensation),  
only what we delight in (and how to obtain *Oneg*).  
The main assumption for making the protocol work  
is that a majority of the QD will be utilised in `work`  

most of the time, so it requires customers with an  
appetite (and also a tolerance) for work, provided  
as a service that they're continously paying for.  
The yield embedded in discounts for QD solves   

the "cold-start problem" of incentivising work  
matching service as such to *Come Together*...   
the cost of using fiat...is...having to pay taxes,   
the cost of using Ethereum: having to pay gas;  

subsidising protection bootstraps tokens' value.  
Following this line of circular reasoning, QU!Dao  
rewards/penalises for protected [crypto](https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1781712882645795202) volatility  
exposure re-staking (or re-hypethcation) with a  
new unit of account, accounted as $1 `dog`/`cat`


Every QD `_balance` is auto-staked (for solvency)...  
however, staked doesn't mean illiquid...QD balances  
may always be `transfer`ed, but there is no way to  

*unstake*. This simply means that...when trading 1 QD  
for 1 sDAI (after a balance has matured) there is the  
possibility of dilution, with respect to `_get_owe`...


To let liquidated debt (or anything wet) dry  
quickly: spread it thinly over a large area‚Ä¶  
it's useful to consider the other dimension   
of investing (biggest risk source is time)...   


### it's the de*ferral* reserve (not federal)
 
favorite feature, like a well-known parable about  
the 11th hour featuring 2 bulls sauntering down  
a hill, but...the most relevant version here is the  
parable of the Chinese farmer (a la John 13:7)...  

"You never count your money, while you're sittin'  
at the table. There'll be time enough for countin'  
when the dealin' done." We never know if the bad  
debt actually happens...in our best interests...like  
Proverbs 11, when all deeds are weighed together.  

To reflect this `_yoga` at the end must be `call`ed  
voluntarily, or protocol collects loss from `Plunge`.   
Governance is one of the coolest features in DeFi.  
Though we save on gas from not compounding for   
depositors constantly, we spend some gas keeping  
the voted median (for APR) perpetually up to date.   


If borrowers pay 8% APR, they can get liquidated  
by the protocol, but in exchange for giving QU!D  
the privilege of liqui**dating** them: may become a  
lottery `winner`...one per MO...merch tag has QR  

code...links to a YT clip. #1 liquidation (5/11/22)      
represented by üëï is passed between contracts   
for new `winner`s. `deuce` (2xAPR) payment is  
an extra option to treat the `work` as [vice versa](https://www.instagram.com/p/CnPsieFKzRQ/),


or to slowly liquidate the `Plunge` over time (pro  
rated price) provided continuous 2x payment for  
the privilege of retaining the **perfection rights**   
(based on a [concept](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celebrity_bond) from liens and mortgages).  

These perfection rights may be sold on ZigZag.
