## !n My Opinion...interMittent Offering (!MO) 

The word "dollar" originally referred to a ([silver](https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/why-powerful-silver-bull-market-may-be-ahead)) "piece of eight," today  
a significant portion of $ usage across all lending markets comes from  
`carry` trades between assets and their derivatives. We've reduced all  

the variables involved, so you end up with a system that is very basic,  
increasing the chances that it's resistant to all types of attacks. Worth  
keeping in mind that optimising capital efficiency may also introduce 2  

types of cash-settled `dues`: `long` or `short` (*Itchy and Scratchy*  
as synthetic `credit` and `debit` in [*CatDog*](https://x.com/QuidMint/status/1786703126470222054)), "you're burning up,  
I'm cooling down...you're [blind](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/blind-entry.asp)...I [see](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fD1_rP8GonSUHyRXENDudlzBkkTcAsN7L9IiTrxEuAY/edit)..." reductions in fixed costs  

accumulate, as variable costs  get amplified by the  volume...

I dread bread redemption...the futures are a projection (net present  
value of force times distance): `work` (leverage is inter-subjective,  
 a.k.a....dependant on the circumstances). Present's value enables  

a certain kind of future, which depends (in turn) on a certain state:

"It's not a performance, it's a ~~ritual~~" perp form, enhanced..."yesterday's  
price is not today's price." 30% of [PCV](https://gist.github.com/0xngmi/c92ce3fce377a0e72c1e90052db98bf1?permalink_comment_id=5071272#gistcomment-5071272) pays APR out-of-pocket (adds  

ETH to `wind.debit`); according to [Excel](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uBG8jJGNCgQArKm4FlcmNuXb1cspG6-PRcDoFaRvQws/), "in the world of  dollars,  
[QD] ain't nothin' but a quarter ü™ô," for plugging a 25% hole in SCR.
 
QD is only minted for 46 days (of Lent), twice a year, for 8 years;  
.22% QD is the cost to start-up, so after deployment, the amount  
is paid to one randomly `clocked` borrower per `SEMESTER`, as in  
[Maren](https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxqTN7HrgUTmngIZrZqfEFUQaI7GM3ZuTo)ate.sol got schooled like [been there]((https://mirror.xyz/quid.eth/LZ4pS8tVAAkZVSYqJWoihs19cdMhgWESsLr9dIhvL40)), done that, bought the  

T-shirt, and .54% of the `raised` was paid to liquidity providers on  
UniswapV3. This means to support entering and exiting from 357M  
supply of QD, there will always be at least 2.7M available on any  
given week while the supply of 271M is locked for 54 weeks 'til  
`call` makes it possible for that amount to be redeemed out... 


`Plunge`s pay more if they want to make money more often,  
borrowing at 85% LTV with shorts *and* liquidation protection.  
Expensive is only relative to what one earns at the end of it:  
the benchmark for best-case scenario is Jim Simons' 66%.

I'm just a line cook...as in credit line, cook as in books.  
Any ETH deposited is insured..."I pay the incidentals,"  
so when withdrawing, the current price is compared  
to what it was at time of deposit (over the course of   
multiple deposits, overall "entry price" is averaged).   



### It's the  de*ferral* reserve (not...federal)...  
"You never count your money...while you're sittin'...  
at the table...there'll be time enough for countin'...  
when the dealin's done:" we can't know if so-called

(e.g. parable of the Chinese farmer, a la John 13:7),   

optimised for gas due to not compounding P&L  
constantly, spending gas instead to keep voted  
medians up to date. Liquidations over $760k are

selected for a lottery: 777,742 QD sportsmanship  
award represented by üëï, passed back and forth  
between `winner`s as the medium for  payouts...

2x APR is a surcharge for spreading liquidations  
over time (pro-rated price), giving the position a  
chance to recover as long as you keep paying the  

premium (up to 27%). Trades which `_unwind`  
profitably may potentially capture gains from  
idle QD minted at a discount (active mgmt  
may win out versus passive management).
