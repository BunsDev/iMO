## in My Opinion...`chroot` for mom.sol

There are two contracts (Marenate, and double sized Moulinette);     
there's `deux` and 2 types of `dues`: for synthetic `long` or `short`  
(think of these as...*Itchy and Scratchy*)...`credit` and `debit` are  
the same force, moving in opposite directions, a bit like *CatDog*...

Tupac wrote *Dear Mama* on the toilet. On many Japanese toilets,  
the hand wash sink is attached so that you can wash your hands  
and reuse the water for the next flush: this [inspired](https://x.com/Rainmaker1973/status/1791387466705908125) our `clutch`

This [transmission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intercarrier_method) is coming to [mix](https://youtu.be/ndQM3kVb06I) under-collat with over-collat  
through...Triforce? Force times distance is `work` (leverage), so
  
`Plunge`s `mint`...`flip`...`vote`...`put`...`owe`...`fold`...`call`   
"lookin' too hot? simmer down, or soon you'll get," `clocked`;  
though liquidations are optional (only for the less risk-averse).


QuidMint Foundation sees over (not over-sieze) [swappable](https://twitter.com/guil_lambert/status/1772423853316219051) options   
in this crypto school of trade-offs, sweat equity, [compensation](https://www.tabers.com/tabersonline/view/Tabers-Dictionary/730522/all/compensation), and   
"yesterday's price is not today's price," in `mint`. 33% of TVL pays  
 APR out of pocket (adds ETH to `wind.debit`), according to [Excel](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uBG8jJGNCgQArKm4FlcmNuXb1cspG6-PRcDoFaRvQws/)

You're paying more if you want to make money more often,  
borrowing at [92 LTV](https://twitter.com/QuidMint/status/1788043869113708955)...with shorts *and* liquidation protection.  
Expensive is only relative to what one earns at the end of it:  
the benchmark for best-case scenario is Jim Simons' 66%.

Any ETH deposited is insured against a fall in value.  
So when withdrawing, the price at time of deposit  
is compared to the current price. Over the course  
of multiple deposits the overall "entry price" of the  
entire deposit is averaged. Cost is upfront payment  
(at least 9%) and an annualized premium 2x of that.

### It's the  de*ferral* reserve (not...federal)  


"you never count your money, while you're sittin'  
at the table. There'll be time enough for countin'  

when the dealin' done." We can't know if so-called  
"bad debt" actually happens...in our best interests  
(e.g. parable of the Chinese farmer, a la John 13:7).   

Optimised for gas due to not compounding P&L  
constantly, spending gas instead to keep voted  
medians up to date, liquidated borowers will be

selected for a lottery; `johnquid`'s [liquidation](https://mirror.xyz/quid.eth/LZ4pS8tVAAkZVSYqJWoihs19cdMhgWESsLr9dIhvL40),   
as
represented by ðŸ‘•, is passed back and forth  
between `winner`s as a medium for  payouts...  
Liquidations are optional: if you like lotteries,  
and want to save on APR payments, [pay 9%](https://x.com/hexonaut/status/1789072324614050035)

`deux` (2x APR) payment is an extra option to treat  
the `work` as [vice versa](https://www.instagram.com/p/CnPsieFKzRQ/),
or `clutch` as pro-rated  
liquidation price, provided continuous 2x payment...  
and up to [3x](https://x.com/santiagoroel/status/1791114254117998865) with surge pricing (responsive to DSR).

The yield embedded in discounts for QD is used   
partially for paying APR...while profitable trades  
(`fold` by active management) can capture gains  
away from *j'ai la flemme*  (passively managed QD);
