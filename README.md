## in My Opinion...sDAI/cNOTE re-staking
*please click all links, or you'll miss MOüî®Lot of context*...  

why borrow for 1% from MKR at 66.66 LTV if you can pay 9%  
and borrow at 92 LTV...with shorts and liquidation protection.

QD is like a promissory note: notes are used for settlement,   
be worth $1 over time, so that's how QD is valued internally.

There's `deux` and 2 types of `dues`: synthetic `long` and `short`  
are like *Itchy and Scratchy*...`credit` and `debit` are like *CatDog*.  

Those are the "primitives"; the main structural elements are sort   
of like hook, line, and sinker: `wind`, `carry`, `work`, respectively.

So, 3 primitives, 3 elements; glue two three's together into 8:  
`mint`...`flip`...`vote`...`put`...`borrow`...`fold`...`call`...and    
"lookin' too hot? simmer down, or soon you'll get," `clocked`;  

these are all of our externally callable functions in MO.sol...a.k.a.

this [transmission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intercarrier_method) is coming to [mix](https://youtu.be/ndQM3kVb06I) under-collat with over-collat.  
 The original Phat Farm slogan was, "the new American [Dream](https://www.youtube.com/clip/Ugkx6KgnkNJTp-w6l-UJbXc0ctnAmo8LgdOU)," 

  
[~~liquidation~~](https://mirror.xyz/quid.eth/LZ4pS8tVAAkZVSYqJWoihs19cdMhgWESsLr9dIhvL40) trouble on my mind: to push a [T-bill](https://twitter.com/OuchMedPA/status/1740514556244623427). Assume 1 sDAI is  
= $1 in ETH emulates a principal-protected characteristic of zero  
-coupon bonds, and [swappable](https://twitter.com/guil_lambert/status/1772423853316219051) [puts](https://twitter.com/futurenomics/status/1766173245949014373) for the `call` to offering, or   

r[ICO](https://twitter.com/QuidMint/status/1786533263139369265) (r stands for recurring). QuidMint Foundation sees over (not  
over-sieze) !MO as a project for futures students'...`work` credits   
in the school of trade-offs, sweat equity, escalation; only what we  
 delight in, It's not good debt versus bad debt [compensation](https://www.tabers.com/tabersonline/view/Tabers-Dictionary/730522/all/compensation),  and  
how to obtain *Oneg*:  "no oxygen, can barely `wind` my darkest sin; 

you ~~raise release~~ *emit...yofee*...and it's all because of,"  no [*cdp*](https://twitter.com/zellic_io/status/1688666477552193536), only   
 way to coin join: `Plunge` into `work` or by !MO `mint`...majority of  
 
the QD will be utilised in `work`, and `vote` casts a time-weighted  
median of what the APR should be (one for long and one for short)  

Requires [customers](https://twitter.com/QuidMint/status/1784201484143358433) with an appetite (and also a tolerance) for risk...  
provided as a service that they're continously paying for...(with `deux`  
and `grace`, or neither). Either way, the result of hot `wind` (*hamsin* in  
Hebrew), is a synonym for gilt or debt in Sanskrit, where they share a  

word with sin. Those who know when to `fold`...may net a profit (as   
an increase to the total debt in the system); otherwise get `clocked`;  

"yesterday's price is not today's price" in !MO. Only 34% of the TVL  
 actually pays 18% for it out of pocket (adding ETH to `wind.debit`),  

or the rest simply pay with their QD (decreasing `wind.credit`): both  
`wind` and `carry` together compose the real collateralisation of QD...

### Through de*ferral* reserve (not federal)

The yield embedded in discounts for QD solves   
the "cold-start problem" of incentivising a risk  
matching service as such to *Come Together*...   

Yield can be used to pay APR...while profitable  
trades (active management) also capture gains  

away from dormant ROI (in !MO participation):  
see `_maturing[owner].credit` in `_call`...   
distinctly, `call` is used to redeem matured QD  

The cost of using fiat...is...having to pay taxes,   
the cost of using Ethereum: having to pay gas.  

When a `Plugne` sells ether to the protocol  
(for APR or CR up-keep)...then this ether is  
deposited (on behalf of QU!D) into mevETH.  

To let liquidated debt (or anything wet) dry  
quickly: spread it thinly over a large area‚Ä¶  
it's useful to consider the other dimension   
of investing (biggest risk source is time)...   

Parable of the Chinese farmer (a la John 13:7)...   
"you never count your money, while you're sittin'  
at the table. There'll be time enough for countin'  

when the dealin' done." We never know if the bad  
debt actually happens...in our best interests...like  
Proverbs 11, when all deeds are weighed together.    

Though we save on gas from not compounding P&L   
from `carry` constantly, we spend a lil gas to keep  
the voted median (for APR) perpetually up to date.   
If borrowers pay 8% APR, they can get ~~liquidated~~...

the graceful debt: liqui**dated** as a `winner`...(1 per  
!MO); `johnquid` liquidation (5/11/22) represented  
by üëï is passed back and forth between `winner`s.  

`deux` (2x APR) payment is an extra option to treat  
the `work` as [vice versa](https://www.instagram.com/p/CnPsieFKzRQ/),
or `grace` as slow option:  
pro-rated price) provided continuous 2x payment,  
any address could pay on behalf of a `Plunge` as  

based on a concept from liens and [mortgages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celebrity_bond)...  
"Secret to survivin' is knowin' what to throw üèÄ  
and knowin' what to keep..." on commodifying 

### Power of ~~Attorney~~ *Advocatus Diaboli* 

A total of 16 MO issuances are scheduled, each  
paying 0.76% to the owner of the lambo NFT...  
this pegs the valuation of QU!D at $16M...the  
lambo may be transferred to a new `driver`
