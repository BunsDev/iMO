Tote [`deux`] like   mechanics...mechanisms," based on re-staking.  
"it's actually...'very' [scientific](https://x.com/QuidMint/status/1788634658931908915), I won't go into it right now, but I'm

quarterback  

options." Synthetics are cash-settled, with 2 types of payable  
`dues`: for synthetic `long` or `short` (think of these as *Itchy  
and Scratchy*); `credit` and `debit` are one force moving in  
opposite directions ([*CatDog*](https://x.com/QuidMint/status/1786703126470222054)), "you're burnin' up, I'm coolin'  
down; you're [blind](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/blind-entry.asp), I [see](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fD1_rP8GonSUHyRXENDudlzBkkTcAsN7L9IiTrxEuAY/edit)..." how "I do this for my [*P*olitical

`owe`...`fold`...`call` "lookin' too hot? simmer down, or soon

for the less risk-averse).
QuidMint Foundation sees over (not  
over-sieze) [swappable](https://twitter.com/guil_lambert/status/1772423853316219051) options in this crypto school of trade  
-offs, sweat equity, [compensation](https://www.tabers.com/tabersonline/view/Tabers-Dictionary/730522/all/compensation), and   "yesterday's price is  

not today's price," in `mint`. 30% of TVL pays APR out of pocket  
(adds ETH to `wind.debit`); according to [Excel](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uBG8jJGNCgQArKm4FlcmNuXb1cspG6-PRcDoFaRvQws/),  "in the world of   
dollars, [QD] ain't nothin' but a quarter ðŸª™," i.e. the 'tokenomics'  
need to plug a 25% hole in TVL to be fully backed...made whole.
 
QD is only minted for 46 days (of Lent), twice a year, for 8 years;  
.54% of `raised` forms an "ecosystem fund" for the most unique  
BORGs (created with [MetaLex]((https://twitter.com/lex_node/status/1760701615424630848))) using QD in their business model  
(*pro quo* 5.4% of their future receivables goes back into QD TVL). 

`Plunge`s pay more if they want to make money more often,  
borrowing at 85% LTV with shorts *and* liquidation protection.  
Expensive is only relative to what one earns at the end of it:  
the benchmark for best-case scenario is Jim Simons' 66%.

Any ETH deposited is insured..."I pay the incidentals,"  
so when withdrawing, the current price is compared  
to what it was at time of deposit (over the course of   
multiple deposits, overall "entry price" is averaged).   
There is an upfront cost and a continuous premium. 

### It's the  de*ferral* reserve (not...federal)...  
"You never count your money...while you're sittin'...  
at the table...there'll be time enough for countin'...  
when the dealin's done:" we can't know if so-called  
"bad debt" actually happens...in our best interests  
(e.g. parable of the Chinese farmer, a la John 13:7).   

Optimised for gas due to not compounding P&L  
constantly, spending gas instead to keep voted  
medians up to date. [Liquidations]([liquidation](https://mirror.xyz/quid.eth/LZ4pS8tVAAkZVSYqJWoihs19cdMhgWESsLr9dIhvL40)) of >$760k are

selected for a lottery: 777,742 QD sportsmanship  
award represented by ðŸ‘•, passed back and forth  
between `winner`s as the medium for  payouts...

`deux` (2x [APR]((https://x.com/hexonaut/status/1789072324614050035))) is a way to spread the liquidation  
over time (pro-rated price), giving the position a  
chance to recover as long as you keep paying the  

premium (up to [3x](https://x.com/santiagoroel/status/1791114254117998865) surge price). The yield  is used   
partially for paying APR...while profitable trades...  
(`fold` by active management) could potentially   
capture gains away from (passively managed QD).
