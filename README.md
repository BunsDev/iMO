## !n My Opinion...`chroot` for MKR's mom.sol...

Ethereum (a commodity) meets ~~flatcoin~~ oil, gas, Au, Ag (basket üèÄ)...  
triple capital efficiency of Synthetix, double features. "Tote [`deux`]  
like mechanics...mechanisms," based on sDAI/cNOTE re-staking...  

there are 2 contracts (Marenate, double sized Moulinette), and     
there's 2 types of `dues`: for synthetic `long` or `short` (think  
of these as...*Itchy and Scratchy*)...`credit` and `debit` are the  
same force...moving in opposite directions...a bit like *CatDog*...  

Tu*pac* wrote *Dear Mama* on the toilet. On many Japanese toilets,  
a hand wash sink is attached to the lid so people can wash hands  
and reuse that water for the next flush: [this](https://x.com/Rainmaker1973/status/1791387466705908125) inspired our `clutch`  
mechanism of preserving the value of liquidations for borrowers:

I like to believe I'm [decent](https://www.youtube.com/clip/UgkxC22X7EFzoZL8TZXwulDkMFPfRf-MZns6), but I'm more of a [cheroot](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/quid) than a cherub,   
"I do this for my [*P*olitical *A*ction *C*ommittee]: walked in the kitchen;  
 found a [`Pod`] to [`Piscine`]...[Nobody's](https://x.com/QuidMint/status/1788581681693106680) satisfied until they mama,"  

this [transmission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intercarrier_method)...coming to [mix](https://youtu.be/ndQM3kVb06I) under-collat with over-collat...  
through...Triforce? "Nobody gives you a chance, you gotta take  
chances. I got a [cup](https://www.youtube.com/clip/UgkxD0PZbIFBnRlmN6JwqGfKBOTw_OR7j1u4) of your [time](https://www.youtube.com/clip/UgkxIOebF-ScgdWWR7Flp__iDVeG4L22y-PK)..." value of money;  force times  
 distance is `work` (leverage), "so now...instead of [pledge](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pledgedasset.asp)...we,"
  
`Plunge` to `mint`...`flip`...`vote`...`put`...`owe`...`fold`...`call`   
"lookin' too hot? simmer down, or soon you'll get," `clocked`;  
though liquidations are [optional](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O25uUy90hU) (only for the less risk-averse).

QuidMint Foundation sees over (not over-sieze) [swappable](https://twitter.com/guil_lambert/status/1772423853316219051) options   
in this crypto school of trade-offs, sweat equity, [compensation](https://www.tabers.com/tabersonline/view/Tabers-Dictionary/730522/all/compensation), and   
"yesterday's price is not today's price," in `mint`. 30% of TVL pays  
 
 APR out of pocket (adds ETH to `wind.debit`); according to [Excel](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uBG8jJGNCgQArKm4FlcmNuXb1cspG6-PRcDoFaRvQws/)  
 "In the world of dollars, [QD] ain't nothin' but a quarter ü™ô," meaning  
 the tokenomics need to plug a 25% hole in TVL to be fully backed...
 
QD is only minted for 46 days (of lent), twice a year, for 8 years;  
.73% of sDAI forms an "ecosystem fund" for pre-seed infusion  
into platforms using QD in their tokenomics (pro quo 7.3% of the  
platforms' future receivables goes back into TVL for backing QD).  

`Plunge`s pay more if they want to make money more often,  
borrowing at 85% LTV with shorts *and* liquidation protection.  
Expensive is only relative to what one earns at the end of it:  
the benchmark for best-case scenario is Jim Simons' 66%.

Any ETH deposited is insured..."I pay the incidentals,"  
so when withdrawing, the current price is compared  
to what it was at time of deposit (over the course of   
multiple deposits, overall "entry price" is averaged).   
There is an upfront cost and a continuous premium. 

### It's the  de*ferral* reserve (not...federal)...  
"You never count your money...while you're sittin'...  
at the table...there'll be time enough for countin'...  
when the dealin's done:" we can't know if so-called  
"bad debt" actually happens...in our best interests  
(e.g. parable of the Chinese farmer, a la John 13:7).   

Optimised for gas due to not compounding P&L  
constantly, spending gas instead to keep voted  
medians up to date. Liquidations of >760k are

selected for a lottery (777742 QD sportsmanship  
award); `johnquid`'s [liquidation](https://mirror.xyz/quid.eth/LZ4pS8tVAAkZVSYqJWoihs19cdMhgWESsLr9dIhvL40) (plus Maren's),   
as
represented by üëï, is passed back and forth  
between `winner`s as the medium for  payouts...

`deux` (2x [APR]((https://x.com/hexonaut/status/1789072324614050035))) is a way to automatically flip `work`,  
think of it as the famous Allen Iverson cross-overs...   
from long to short or [vice versa](https://www.instagram.com/p/CnPsieFKzRQ/) at the moment that  
it would have otherwise been liquidated,
or `clutch`  

as a way to spread the liquidation over time (pro-rated  
price), giving the position a chance to recover as long  
as you keep paying the premium (up to [3x](https://x.com/santiagoroel/status/1791114254117998865) surge price)

The yield embedded in discounts for QD is used   
partially for paying APR...while profitable trades...  
(`fold` by active management) can capture gains  
away from *j'ai la flemme*  (passively managed QD)...  
3 Tibetan humors: `carry` is ü©∏, `wind` is *hielo* bile;  

another way to [see](https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxXxCLFiMg7N55Aj2SjkpA87TeBJao6EWY?si=4v3xY1nYgtJovNmx) it: salt of the üåç, [ball ‚ö°Ô∏è](https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxTJhmTNvuccOEkvQ9NwRrJG_kh3hhofK-?si=qlXeZ24vCvjNmnnb), and...  
Mercury bank seems to have a great `work` record.

### The Big Question (answered in a future repo)

If borrowers are making money more often, where does  
the solvency capital come from to stabilize the system?  
How can we print gains from thin air without needing to  

over-collateralize minting by 400%, or simply "kicking  
the can down the road," as our saving grace? [Human](https://www.youtube.com/clip/UgkxE82FRchwVKme9RDS2MTL-sX1P5IhRrsh)  
capital: "the answer's not in the [box](https://x.com/QuidMint/status/1679900489046011916), it's in the ~~band~~,"  

box...office. Phat Farm's slogan is "the new American  
[dream](https://www.youtube.com/clip/Ugkx6KgnkNJTp-w6l-UJbXc0ctnAmo8LgdOU)." There are good actors, bad actors, and those  
whose actions are good or bad. Careers have ups and   

downs...what if ~~they were [SPVs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celebrity_bond)~~ your LinkedIn was sort  
of a memecoin that worked more like a bond with some  
volatility protection to get you through the tough times,  
as well as keep your ~~followers~~ investors from losing out?
