## !n My Opinion...interMittent Offering (!MO) 

The word "dollar" was originally known as a ([silver](https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/why-powerful-silver-bull-market-may-be-ahead)) "piece of eight"...   
a significant portion of usage across all lending markets comes from  
`carry` trades between assets and their derivatives. To understand  
the latter, we need a basic feel for the concept's [chemical](https://mirror.xyz/quid.eth/LZ4pS8tVAAkZVSYqJWoihs19cdMhgWESsLr9dIhvL40) origins...  

 We've heavily reduced all the variables involved, so you end up with a  
system that is very basic, increasing the chances that it's resistant to  
all types of attacks. It's worth keeping in mind that optimising capital  
efficiency (less over-collat) may also introduce a degree of fragility... 

"Tote tools like mechanics...mechanisms," based on re-staking;  
Unlike rehypothecation, in crypto restaking the initial owner of  
 the stake retains control, keeping with the self-custody ethos.


2 types of cash-settled `dues`: for synthetic `long` or `short`  
(think of these as *Itchy and Scratchy*); `credit` and `debit`   
are one force moving in opposite directions (a la [*CatDog*](https://x.com/QuidMint/status/1786703126470222054)),  
"you're burnin' up, I'm coolin' down; you're [blind](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/blind-entry.asp), I [see](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fD1_rP8GonSUHyRXENDudlzBkkTcAsN7L9IiTrxEuAY/edit)..."

the property that at some point in the future they will be  
redeemable for their underlying property. The future is a  
projection (the net present value of force times distance): 

`work` (leverage is always inter-subjective, profitable or not  
depending on the circumstances). The present has value as  
it enables a certain kind of future, which depends (in turn) on  
a certain state of the present..."so now...instead of [pledge](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pldgedasset.asp)...we,"  

`Plunge` to `mint`...`flip`...`vote`...`put`...`owe`...`fold`...`call`;  
"lookin' too hot? simmer down, or soon you'll get," `clocked`...  
though liquidations are [optional](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O25uUy90hU) (only for the less risk-averse)...  

QuidMint Foundation sees over (not over-sieze) [swappable](https://twitter.com/guil_lambert/status/1772423853316219051) options  
in this crypto school of trade-offs, sweat equity, [compensation](https://www.tabers.com/tabersonline/view/Tabers-Dictionary/730522/all/compensation), and  
"yesterday's price is not today's price," in `mint`. 30% of TVL pays  

APR out-of-pocket (adds ETH to `wind.debit`); according to [Excel](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uBG8jJGNCgQArKm4FlcmNuXb1cspG6-PRcDoFaRvQws/),  
"in the world of  dollars, [QD] ain't nothin' but a quarter ðŸª™," i.e. the  
'tokenomics' need to plug a 25% hole in TVL to be...made whole...
 
QD is only minted for 46 days (of Lent), twice a year, for 8 years;  
.54% of `raised` is split between [claims](https://www.mevauction.com/Relay/captive-insurance/) and an "ecosystem fund"  
for the most [unique](https://www.linkedin.com/company/spirelabs) BORGs (formed with [MetaLex](https://twitter.com/lex_node/status/1760701615424630848)) using QD and/or  
leveraging the best app-chain [framework](https://x.com/Spire_Labs/status/1792924761850265633) in their business model   
(*pro quo* 5.4% of their future receivables goes back into QD TVL). 


`Plunge`s pay more if they want to make money more often,  
borrowing at 85% LTV with shorts *and* liquidation protection.  
Expensive is only relative to what one earns at the end of it:  
the benchmark for best-case scenario is Jim Simons' 66%.

Any ETH deposited is insured..."I pay the incidentals,"  
so when withdrawing, the current price is compared  
to what it was at time of deposit (over the course of   
multiple deposits, overall "entry price" is averaged).   
There is an upfront cost and a continuous premium. 

### It's the  de*ferral* reserve (not...federal)...  
"You never count your money...while you're sittin'...  
at the table...there'll be time enough for countin'...  
when the dealin's done:" we can't know if so-called  
"bad debt" actually happens...in our best interests  
(e.g. parable of the Chinese farmer, a la John 13:7).   

Optimised for gas due to not compounding P&L  
constantly, spending gas instead to keep voted  
medians up to date. Liquidations over $760k are

selected for a lottery: 777,742 QD sportsmanship  
award represented by ðŸ‘•, passed back and forth  
between `winner`s as the medium for  payouts...

2x APR is a surcharge for spreading liquidations  
over time (pro-rated price), giving the position a  
chance to recover as long as you keep paying the  

premium (up to 27%). Trades which `_unwind`  
profitably may potentially capture gains from  
idle QD minted at a discount (active mgmt  
may win out versus passive management).
