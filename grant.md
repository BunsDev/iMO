### Project Overview:

[Derivatives](https://twitter.com/lex_node/status/1740509787690086847) derive their value from an underlying asset. Our certicificate of deposite (CD) is a [Capital Deepening](https://www.wallstreetmojo.com/capital-deepening/)  
token (QD) deriving value from sDAI, and demand for borrowing and lending ETH with maximal capital efficiency.  

ETH public keys are 42 characters; Arbitrum's chainId starts with 42; sDAI's public key ends with 42üêù, `quid.eth`'s  
starts with 42. Bridging liquidity (benefitting the entire Arbitrum ecosystem as a result), this project seeks to extend  


### its team members:

Before Euromaidan, Ukraine had one of the world's first central bank-tethered digital currencies, issued by a company  
whose EIN was 36**42**51**42** (without the use of DLT): interned there as a paralegal before learning C through http://42.fr ;   
after that, helped build the [predecessor](https://patentscope.wipo.int/search/en/detail.jsf?docId=WO2020102401) to Liquity on EOS, then worked for Bancor, also audited THOR and bZx (CertiK)  


### Use of funds, milestones, and goals (KPIs):

- Mainnet Launch: June 1st...  
- Arbitrum Launch: June 27th
- User Adoption: 357M QD in    
 Q2
(same minted within Q4)  
  544M sDAI locked for 2024...  
as reach goal (minimum [54M](https://twitter.com/WethWood/status/1786389167292772697))
  
- Contract Interaction: Facilitate at least  
  1000 `Plunge` positions, which, instead  
  of importing liquidity step-wise as we're     
  used to with CDPs, employ a wholesale  
  incentivisastion program, that benefits 
- Partnerships: Milestone 2 and onwards


### Milestone 1:

To arrive at its current level simplicity, Quid Labs had to rebuild its protocol 3 times over the last 3 years; latest implementation:  
just over 800 lines. The majority of the work for this milestone is devoted to testing this implementation, while also extending  
`frontend` functionality. We already have a contract (Lot.sol) dedicated to Uniswap, incentivising V3 liquidity deposits with  

Tether to give QD a way to earn outside of being used in QU!D protocol. Potentially, all the sDAI that gets locked in PCV can  
also be deployed as single-sided liquidity in a pool with sDAI and ETH. We may extend our medianiser to vote between UNI  
and other liquidity pools (for % of sDAI to lock in AMMs against ETH), but this is seen as V2 feature (given enough interest),  


Also as part of the 1st milestone, `yo.quid.io` will be the first external operator (QU!D Ltd in BVI) running `frontend`  
standalone web application for the protocol (currently just allows minting,
and seeing some basic stats: e.g. P&L...etc).  

| Number | Deliverable | Specification |
| -----: | ----------- | ------------- |
| **0a.** | License | GPLv3 Copyleft is the  technique of granting certain freedoms over copies of copyrighted works with the requirement that the same rights be preserved in *derivative* works (hint)... |
| 1. | Withdrawal (`call`) buttons | ETH may be freely deposited and withdrawn, meanwhile used to boost pledges. QD redemption (for sDAI) has rules based on when the QD was minted.  |
| 2. | Vertical fader | All the way down by default, there should be one input slider for the magnitude of either long leverage, or short (and a toggle to switch between the two. Touching the toggle once automatically triggers 2xAPR, and this must be manually disabled).|
| 3a. | Cross-fader for balance | This slider will represent how much of the user‚Äôs total QD is deposited in `work`, and how much is in `carry` (by default the whole balance is left‚Ä¶in `carry`). |
| 3b. | Cross-faders for voting | Shorts and longs are treated as separate risk budgets, so there is one APR target for each (combining them could be a worthy experiment, definitely better UX, though not necessarily optimal from an analytical standpoint). Median APR (for long or short) is 8-21%...voting provides a scale factor for roughly up to 3x surge pricing. |
| 4. | Basic Metrics |  Provide a side by side comparison of key metrics: aggregated for all users, and from the perspective of the authenticated user (who‚Äôs currently logged in, e.g. individual risk-adjusted returns); see most recently liquidated (sorted by time or size); top borrowers in terms of P&L, volume, duration. |
| 5. | Simulation [Metrics](https://orus.info/) | Future projections for the output of the `call` function, with varying inputs of how is being leveraged in `work` at the time of calling the function, as well as what % of borrowers were profitable over the course of the previous year.  |


### Milestone 2:


| Number | Deliverable | Specification |
| -----: | ----------- | ------------- |
| **0a.** | License GPLv3 | Copyleft (same as previous milestone‚Äôs‚Ä¶of the public, by the public, for the public). |
| **0b.** | Documentation |  We provide both code comments and instructions for running the protocol as well as sanity checking the operability with some test transactions. |
| 1. | NFT marketplaces + Fiat [off-ramps](https://www.flashy.cash/) + deployment | Exclusive NFT [marketplaces](http://polyone.io) will enable payment with QD (for preferential pricing of NFTs) as a well as other bonuses. Providing real-world utility for our token (beyond crypto trading) is further possible through trusted partners for bridging into the domain of bank accounts and cash. |
| 2. | Event bus (Watcher) | Publish code that reads the blockchain for liquidation opportunities, so anyone can run it. Later, this code could be potentially integrated with ZigZag exchange's off-chain order matcher for purchasing a liqudiated position's collateral, valued by its debt at the time of liquidation (abstracting out `clutch`). |
| 3. | Kickoff [Twitter spaces](https://t.ly/B7pin) | Demonstrate the extent of readiness of the frontend by interacting with all protocol functions (minting is the only thing that may be done for the first 46 days after deloyment). |
| 4. | Protocol integrations (multi-collateral) | CCIP will enable re-using the same QD tokens across deployments of the core protocol (MO) on multiple EVMs (each having their own domain-specific plugins, such as cNOTE on CANTO as the local  alternative for sDAI, as well as RedStone instead of Chainlink). |
| 5. |  UX personalisation (preferences profile) | Advancing on the frontend results from milestone 1, users should have the ability to pull insights into their  should include push notifications based on more data feeds (to better inform trading decisions). Over-bought / over-sold signaling can involve a handful of technical analysis indicators (e.g. RSI, MACD, SMA, BBands). Other kind of indicators (globally significant astrological insights) are also a pontential vector of exploration. |
